# multifreeze

An HTML/JS app for performing a "spectral freezing" effect on any audio file supplied. There are 24 sub-bands to play with, and the user can freeze and unfreeze parts or all of the spectrum as the sound plays.

Shout-outs again to [katspaugh](https://github.com/katspaugh/), author of the excellent [wavesurfer.js](https://github.com/katspaugh/wavesurfer.js) on which this app is built, and to [Chris Cannam](https://thebreakfastpost.com/2015/10/18/ffts-in-javascript/) for the web-assembly implementation of the FFT. 

[Marco Gomez](https://codepen.io/mgzme) designed the CSS "[vertical flip switches](https://codepen.io/mgzme/pen/OqqeLM)" that control the filterbank.
